"""Week 5 studio — starter (Diffie-Hellman, MITM, and the trust-store attack).

Fill in the four functions below, then run ``python3 test_dh_pki.py``. All
required tests must pass, INCLUDING the two *guarantee* tests that watch a
protocol guarantee collapse:

  * ``test_mitm_breaks_unauthenticated_dh`` — unauthenticated DH is MITM'd:
    Mallory ends up sharing a key with each side, and Alice and Bob share
    nothing. Secrecy held on every leg; authentication was never there.
  * ``test_trust_store_poisoning_accepts_forgery`` — a forged chain is REJECTED
    at the trust anchor, then ACCEPTED the instant the rogue root is added to
    the store. The math never broke; the trust anchor did.

The RSA/cert machinery (``make_cert``, ``validate``, ``verify``) and the DH group
(``DH_P``, ``DH_G``) are GIVEN in ``dh_pki.py`` — do not reimplement them.
