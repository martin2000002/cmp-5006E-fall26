"""Week 10 studio — starter (RAG exfil, confused-deputy exfil, containment).

Fill in the THREE functions marked TODO below. Then run
``python3 test_studio.py``. All provided tests must pass — INCLUDING the
guarantee test that watches least privilege *contain* an attack it cannot
*prevent*: WITHOUT your policy the confused-deputy chain exfiltrates the secret;
WITH your dispatcher-enforced allow-list the SAME injection still lands in the
model (coverage stays 0%) yet nothing leaves the building (100% containment).

Nothing you write stops the model from being fooled. Week 9 established that
prompt injection has no clean fix. This week's win is *architecture*: least
privilege bounds what a fooled model is able to DO, and — unlike an output
filter — that is a guarantee you can state, because it is enforced in Python the
model cannot talk past.

Everything runs on your machine. No Docker, no Ollama, no GPU: the app is
imported in-process and forced onto its deterministic mock backend (see the
GIVEN wiring below). See ../../resources/ethics-and-scope.md.
