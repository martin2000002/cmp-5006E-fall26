"""Week 2 studio — starter (entropy, the one-time pad, and the two-time-pad break).

Fill in the four functions below, then run ``python3 test_otp.py``. All provided
tests must pass — INCLUDING the guarantee test, which asserts two things at once:

  * the OTP used ONCE is unbreakable (the SAME ciphertext decrypts to two
    different meaningful messages under two different keys — so it favours
    neither), and
  * the OTP key used TWICE collapses completely (c1 XOR c2 = p1 XOR p2, and
    crib-dragging recovers both plaintexts).

A provable guarantee (perfect secrecy) destroyed by one broken condition (use the
key once) is the whole payload of the week. Watch it happen.

The engine (XOR, entropy, unicity, the crib-drag printability test) is provided in
``otp.py`` — do not reimplement it; call it.
